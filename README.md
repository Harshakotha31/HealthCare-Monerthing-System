Existing health monitoring systems mainly focus on collecting and displaying patient vital signs but lack intelligent analysis and real-time alert mechanisms. In the proposed system, real-time data is stored in the cloud, visualized through an interactive dashboard, and analyzed using anomaly detection techniques. The system automatically identifies abnormal readings and triggers emergency alerts, improving patient monitoring efficiency and response time.
